# custom-proton

A thin overlay on top of [CachyOS/proton-cachyos](https://github.com/CachyOS/proton-cachyos).

This repo holds **no Proton source** — only patches and a GitHub Actions workflow. The
workflow clones upstream at a branch you choose, applies the patches on top, builds it
with the CPU optimisation you pick, and hands you the result as a downloadable artifact.

```
*.patch                       applied to the upstream checkout, in sorted order
.github/workflows/build.yml   the build workflow
```

## Building

1. Go to the **Actions** tab → **Build Proton-CachyOS** → **Run workflow**.
2. Fill in the inputs (defaults are fine) and hit the green button.
3. When it finishes, download the `.tar.xz` from the run's **Artifacts** section.

### Inputs

| Input | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `branch` | `cachyos-11.0-20260702-slr` | Branch **or tag** of `CachyOS/proton-cachyos` to build from. Prefer an `-slr` **tag** — see below |
| `march` | `zen4` | CPU target. One of `zen4`, `zen3`, `zen2`, `x86-64-v4`, `x86-64-v3`, `nocona` |
| `stock` | `false` | Tick to apply **no patches** — a stock upstream build with optimisations only. Shortens the name postfix accordingly |
| `dry_run` | `false` | Validate only — checkout, patch and configure, then stop. Takes ~5 min instead of hours. Use it to check that a new upstream branch still applies cleanly before committing to a full build |

`march` selects `CFLAGS` only (`nocona` is upstream's stock setting):

| `march` | `CFLAGS` |
|---|---|
| `zen4` | `-O3 -march=znver4 -mtune=znver4` |
| `zen3` | `-O3 -march=znver3 -mtune=znver3` |
| `zen2` | `-O3 -march=znver2 -mtune=znver2` |
| `x86-64-v4` | `-O3 -march=x86-64-v4 -mtune=core-avx2` |
| `x86-64-v3` | `-O3 -march=x86-64-v3 -mtune=core-avx2` |
| `nocona` | `-O3 -march=nocona -mtune=core-avx2` |

`RUSTFLAGS` is always `-Copt-level=3 -Ctarget-cpu=nocona`, regardless of `march`. That is
deliberate and matches upstream, which pairs even its `x86-64-v3` build with nocona Rust
flags. The SteamRT SDK's bundled rustc does not recognise newer CPU names — an
unrecognised `-Ctarget-cpu` is silently ignored and LLVM falls back to a subtarget that
cannot emit 64-bit code, so `gst-plugins-rs` fails with *"LLVM ERROR: 64-bit code
requested on a subtarget that doesn't support it"* about 90 minutes into the build.
The Rust components are a small part of the tree; the C/C++ bulk still gets your `march`.

### How long it takes

A cold first run is the slow one — expect **1–3 hours**. Subsequent runs with the same
`branch` + `march` reuse a ccache and typically land around **35–45 minutes**. The job
cap is 350 minutes. Runners are free and unlimited because this repo is public.

## Which upstream branch should I pick?

Upstream tags and branches carry suffixes that are easy to misread:

- **`slr`** — *Steam Linux Runtime*. Runs inside Valve's pinned SLR container, exactly
  like official Proton (`require_tool_appid 4183110`). This is what CachyOS maintainers
  recommend "for maximum compatibility", and the only variant their own CI publishes.
  **This is the one you want**, and it's what the default branch produces.
- **`native`** — links against your host's system libraries instead, with no container.
  Avoids the SLR layer but depends on your distro's `lib32-*` packages (which Arch is
  progressively dropping) and is more likely to trip over anti-cheat.
- **`base`** — *not an end-user build.* It's an internal rebase anchor: upstream Proton
  at that date, before CachyOS's wine fork and patch stack are reapplied. It ships with
  roughly half the submodules. Don't build it.
- **`experimental-11.0-<date>`** / **`experimental-bleeding-edge-…`** — mirrors of
  **Valve's** upstream tags recording which Proton Experimental commit a CachyOS release
  was rebased onto. Tracking markers, not CachyOS flavours.
- **`_sauce` / `_action` / `_umu` / `_native`** — rolling feature branches that get merged
  into each dated release. `_sauce` is the feature grab-bag, `_action` is CI, `_umu` is
  umu-launcher integration.

There is **no `-c` variant**. A trailing letter such as `20260724c` is Valve's own
same-day disambiguator on their upstream tags.

### Prefer an `-slr` tag over a dated branch

**Dated `cachyos_11.0_YYYYMMDD/main` branches are deleted once superseded**, and not every
dated line ever gets released. The `20260713` line, for instance, built out to a full
stack and was then dropped without ever receiving an `-slr` tag; its branch no longer
exists. Release tags are permanent, so build from those. List them:

```sh
git ls-remote --tags https://github.com/CachyOS/proton-cachyos 'refs/tags/cachyos-11.0-*-slr' \
  | sed 's|.*/tags/||' | grep -v '\^{}' | sort | tail
```

The newest `-slr` tag is the newest finished release. A date that has only a `-base` tag
and no `-slr` is **not** finished.

**Why a `-base`-only ref cannot be built:** CachyOS pushes each dated line at its `-base`
rebase anchor first and applies the wine fork and feature stack afterwards. In that
intermediate state it carries roughly half the submodules and still points wine at
upstream's relative `../wine`, which resolves to a repository that does not exist — the
submodule fetch then fails with a confusing credential prompt. To check any ref:

```sh
git describe --long --tags        # in a checkout of that ref
```

`cachyos-11.0-20260724-base-0-g…` — offset `0` from a `-base` tag means **not ready**.
`cachyos-11.0-20260702-slr-0-g…` — a `-slr` tag means a finished release, good to build.
The workflow enforces this and stops early with a clear message rather than failing deep
in the submodule fetch.

## Naming

Builds are named `proton-zi0p4tch0-<version>-<postfix>`, where the version comes from
`git describe --tags` on the ref you built and the postfix ends in your `march` target:

```
proton-zi0p4tch0-11.0-20260702-slr-zen4
└──────────── version ───────────┘└──┘ postfix
```

Building an exact tag yields the bare tag name; a ref that sits past a tag keeps its
`-N-g<sha>` offset so the build stays identifiable. Names are kept short deliberately —
Steam's Gamemode UI truncates long compatibility-tool names in the dropdown.

A `stock` build and a patched build of the same ref get different postfixes, so both can
sit in `compatibilitytools.d` at once and be compared from Steam's dropdown.

That exact string is what Steam shows in its compatibility-tool dropdown. It reaches
there via a single knob — `configure.sh --build-name=` → the `BUILD_NAME` make variable →
`sed` substitution into `compatibilitytool.vdf`'s `display_name` field
(`Makefile.in:1862`). The same variable also names the tarball and the
`compatibilitytools.d/` install directory, so everything stays consistent.

Note that `toolmanifest_x86_64.vdf` carries no name field at all — only `commandline`,
`require_tool_appid` and friends. The user-visible name lives solely in
`compatibilitytool.vdf`.

## Installing the result

The run's **Artifacts** section gives you a single `<build-name>.zip`. GitHub always wraps
artifacts in a zip — that cannot be turned off — so unwrap it once, then extract the
tarball inside:

```sh
unzip proton-zi0p4tch0-….zip                  # yields the .tar.xz and its .sha512sum
sha512sum -c proton-zi0p4tch0-….sha512sum     # optional
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/Steam/compatibilitytools.d
tar -xf proton-zi0p4tch0-….tar.xz -C ~/.local/share/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/
```

The tarball contains a single top-level directory named after the build, so it lands as
`~/.local/share/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/<build-name>/` with no extra nesting. Check it:

```sh
ls ~/.local/share/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/*/compatibilitytool.vdf
```

If you run Steam via Flatpak the path is
`~/.var/app/com.valvesoftware.Steam/data/Steam/compatibilitytools.d` instead.

Restart Steam, then pick the build under
*Properties → Compatibility → Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool*.

## Caveat: AVX and `-march=znver4`

Upstream's `Makefile.in` unconditionally appends `-mno-avx -mno-avx2 -mno-avx512f` after
computing `x86_64_CFLAGS` (lines 113–114 for GCC, 121–122 for Clang). Since last-flag-wins,
`-march=znver4` still gives you znver4 scheduling plus BMI1/BMI2/LZCNT/MOVBE/ADX, but
**not** AVX2/AVX-512 codegen. This is intentional and matches what upstream's own
`x86-64-v3` build does. The workflow does not fight it.

## Patches

Every `*.patch` at the repo root is applied, in sorted order, with `git apply` from the
root of the upstream checkout. A patch that fails to apply stops the run immediately, so
after an upstream bump use `dry_run` to check before starting a full build.
